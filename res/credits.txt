I (Martin) want to thank the following people for their great contributions to Infra Arcana:

* Christopher Barrett ("Oryx") - Provided a fantastic and elegant tile set, and even continued to support and maintain the graphics long after the first draft was ready.

* Agata Skrzypczyk - Contributed a gorgeous logo and icon.

* Kornel Dabrowiecki - Contributed countless ideas for gameplay improvements

* Paul Onyschuk - Provided much feedback and ideas, and also some code and an improved Makefile.

* Musica Cthulhiana for letting me use their track "Madness" from the album "Fragment" as music in the main menu.

* Everyone who gave praise, ideas, and motivation on the old Infra Arcana forum, 4chan, Roguetemple, RPGCodex, Bay12 Games, Youtube, etc...
